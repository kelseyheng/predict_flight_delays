# Predicting domestic flight delays in the US #

Data was obtained from https://www.transtats.bts.gov/DL_SelectFields.asp?Table_ID=236

In this project, I used various classification algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Naive Bays, Decision Tree and Random Forestto predict if domestic flights will be delayed during the December holidays.

Workbooks cover the initial model selection and RandomGridSearchCV for the top performing model.
